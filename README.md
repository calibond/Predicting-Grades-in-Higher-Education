# Predicting-Grades-in-Higher-Education
This project is part of the ***Data Mining and Analytics*** and aims to analyze and predict student grades in higher education using data-driven techniques. The study explores various features that influence academic performance and develops predictive models to estimate student grades.
***Note***: This was a group project
## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Investigate factors affecting student performance and build a predictive model for final grades.
- **Dataset:** `higher_ed_grades.csv` containing student demographic, academic, and behavioral features.
- **Methods Used:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and machine learning models.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis of student performance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying relevant predictors such as attendance, study time, and parental education.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Training regression and classification models to predict student grades.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing accuracy and performance using metrics such as RMSE, RÂ², and classification accuracy.
